==NAME==
    ziptool - purify pkzip archive files

==SYNOPSIS==
    ziptool pure.pk3 unpure.pk3

==DESCRIPTION==
    ZIPTool allows Quake3 hackers to distribute client-side modificaitons which
    can circumvent a game servers set to pure.

    As of ZIPTool 2.0.0, you can now specify archives with arbitrary file counts
    and file displacement within the archive and ZIPTool will only purify the
    files with common file names and paths.

    The only command format is
        
        ====ziptool pure.pk3 unpure.pk3====

    where pure.pk3 is the valid archive that the server is expecting and
    unpure.pk3 is the archive that contains the client-side modifications that
    the server would not normally allow.

    ZIPTool will modify the file inplace, once you've purified the archive most
    unzip based utilities will likely give errors on extraction, this is to be
    expected as the CRC32 checksums are overwritten and will not match (i.e.
    the archive has been purified).

==OPTIONS==
    There are currently no supported options.

    to see basic usage and package info run ziptool without any arguements.

        ====ziptool====

==DIAGNOSTICS==
    Error messages and they're causes


    ===="Error file_name is not compatible with ziptool"====

    you've probably used some fancy schmancy tool to build your archives deeming
    them incompatible with ziptool.


    ===="Error building file list from file_name"====

    somehow you've managed to make the archive unreadable yet bypass the
    archive validation, this is likely due to corruption of the archive.

    ===="Error writing local header(s) to file_name"====

    ===="Error writing central directory record(s) to file_name"====

    there was an issue writing to the unpure archive, this is likely due to 
    corruption of the archive.

    Report Bugs to <http://code.google.com/p/ziptool/issues/list>

==KNOWN ISSUES==
    ziptool 1.0.0 only handled archives of same file count and same file 
    displacement.

    ziptool 2.0.0 no validation of archives, would likely lead to corruption
    of the unpure archive.

    ziptool 2.1.0 if a pure archive was invalid ziptool did not properly exit
    and tried to continue.

    ziptool 2.1.1 and older are only compatible with little endian systems.
