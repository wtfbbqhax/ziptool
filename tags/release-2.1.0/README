ZIPTool version 2.0.0 is simpler better version of ziptool 1.0.0.

Ziptool allows Quake3 hackers to modify they're client side files and then
purify the data so that it will work on pure only servers.

* note: will only work on little-endian systems (Intel,AMD,etc..)

Differences from the initial 1.0.0 version:
  - C++ backend
  - Arbitrary file purification
  - Modifies the unpure archive inline instead of creating a new archive.

To Be Done in 2.1.x
  - Refactor all the lame code
  - Refactor the similar loops
  - Use relative offsets vs absolute offsets on file write.
  - Add some getopt foo

To Be Done in 2.2.x
  - Fix endian issues
  - Everything else 

How to compile:
./configure
make
sudo make install

Run as follows, replacing pure.pk3 with the legit archive and unpure.pk3 with
yours.

ziptool pure.pk3 unpure.pk3
