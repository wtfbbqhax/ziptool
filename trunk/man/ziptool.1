ziptool
\- Purify Quake3 PK3 archives 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBziptool\fP
\fIpure.pk3\fP
\fIunpure.pk3\fP
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

ziptool
is a tool that allows hackers to distribute 
client\-size modifications to Quake3 based games which would 
otherwise be blocked by server side pure mode settings. 
.PP
ziptool
takes the CRC32 values from the pure archive and 
write those into the unpure archive for the files whose names are 
commmon between the 2 archives. 
.PP
This exposes a bug in the minizip library utilized in the Quake3 
client code where the checksums from the archive are used to 
determine whether or not an archive is pure but doesn\&'t validate 
that those checksums are valid for the files contained within the 
archive. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

ziptool
takes no options. 
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Error messages and they\&'re causes 
.PP
\fBError <file name> is not compatible with ziptool\fP
.PP
you\&'ve probably used some fancy schmancy tool to build your archives 
deeming them incompatible with ziptool. 
.PP
\fBError building file list from <file name>\fP
.PP
somehow you\&'ve managed to make the archive unreadable yet bypass the 
archive validation, this is likely due to corruption of the archive. 
.PP
\fBError writing local header(s) to <file name>\fP
.PP
\fBError writing central directory record(s) to <file name>\fP
.PP
there was an issue writing to the unpure archive, this is likely due 
to corruption of the archive.
